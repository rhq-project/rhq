   <p>You should have arrived at this page by clicking on a Resource
      tab defined by the sample perspective.
      As evidenced by the URL in your browser's address bar, this
      page was loaded from the core RHQ GUI. However, the
      pink portion of this page is an IFRAME whose content was
      loaded from rhq-sample-perspective.war, a WAR deployed to the
      RHQ Server, as a sibling of rhq.ear.</p>
