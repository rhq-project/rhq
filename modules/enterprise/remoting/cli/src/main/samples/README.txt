Overview
---------
The scripts located in the samples directory are intended for demonstration
purposes to illustrate functionality and features in the CLI. These scripts
have not undergone the same level of testing as other parts of the code base.
As such, the quality may not meet RHQ standards in some cases. Please consider
this when using these scripts for anything other than demonstration or testing.

There may be inter-dependencies between some of the scripts. There is currently
no mechanism in place to automatically handle script-level dependencies;
consequently, you need to make sure to run scripts in the correct order. If a
script has a dependency on other scripts, it will be documented within the
script itself so that you know which scripts need to be run and in what order.


Feedback
--------
The CLI is still a relatively new, young feature. We welcome and encourage
feedback. Please send questions, comments, etc. to
rhq-users@lists.fedorahosted.org or and/or to rhq-devel@lists.fedorahosted.org
or use the forums at http://community.jboss.org/en/jopr

Thanks

RHQ development team
