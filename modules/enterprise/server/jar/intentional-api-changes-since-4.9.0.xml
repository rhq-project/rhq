    <justification>In RHQ 4.8 the MeasurementAggregate class was moved from server jar module to core domain module. This change is not backward compatible with Java clients using the remote EJB API. The breaking change was introduced by commit 2f6e74080e2299 the backward compatible change was introduced by c2a609f48d5f36.</justification>

    <justification>Adding a method to a remote API interface is safe. This is method is added in order to deprecate the getAggregate. For more details see the previous intentional change.</justification>

    <to>java.util.List</to>
    <justification> While this is technically a welcome change (because impl  of that method returned the PageList anyway), it breaks the strongly typed clients, because the methods are linked by their full signature and hence a library compiled against JON312GA version of that remote will fail to find the method with the new signature and will fail with NoSuchMethodError at runtime.</justification>
