               The time in milliseconds that the client sender will wait
               before aborting a command. This is the amount of time in
               milliseconds that the agent has in order to process commands.
               This value is only the default if a command has not specified
               its own timeout.  A command can override this by setting its
               own timeout in the command's configuration, so this value may
               not be used for all commands that are sent. If this value is
               less than or equal to 0, there will be no default timeout
               and commands will therefore be allowed to take as long as they
               need (again, this is the default, individual commands may
               override this and set their own timeout).  While this infinite
               timeout default could conceivably cause a thread to hang

               the amount of short-lived threads created by the system

               This is the minimum amount of time, in milliseconds, the client

               that previously failed.  This is not a guarantee of when
               a command is retried - all that can be inferred is that a
               command that fails to be sent will not be retried until at
               least this amount of time passes.
               Note: if the sender is currently waiting in this retry pause
               period, the server will not be able to be shutdown until that
               retry period is over. In other words, if the server is asked
               to shutdown, it will wait for those commands waiting in this
               retry interval to wake up. This is to help ensure those
               commands are not lost.

               If a guaranteed delivery message is sent, but the server fails
               to connect to the agent and deliver the message, it will
               always be retried. However, if the error was something other
               than a "cannot connect" error, the command will only be retried
               this amount of times before the command is dropped. When this
               happens, the guaranteed command will never be delivered. This
               will normally happen under very odd and rare circumstances.
               Also, this setting only effects asynchronous messages that
               are sent with guaranteed delivery.  This setting has no effect

               rhq.server.client.command-spool-file.params
               
               This defines the parameters for the command spool file.
               The spool file is where the server persists commands that
               are flagged for guaranteed delivery and need to be sent.
               The format is defined as "max-file-size:purge-percentage".
               The first number is the size, in bytes, of the maximum file
               size threshold.  If the spool file grows larger than this, a
               "purge" will be triggered in order to shrink the file.
               The second number is the purge percentage which indicates how
               large the file is allowed to be after a purge.  This is
               specified as a percentage of the first parameter - the max
               file size threshold.  For example, if the max file size is
               100000 (i.e. 100KB) and the purge percentage is 90, then when
               the spool file grows larger than 100KB, a purge will be
               triggered and the file will be shrunk to no more than
               90% of 100KB - which is 90KB.  In effect, 10KB will be freed
               to allow room for new commands to be spooled.  When this
               occurs, unused space is freed first and if that does not
               free up enough space, the oldest commands in the spool file
               will be sacrificed in order to make room for the newer
               commands.

               If this flag is true, the commands stored in the spool file
               will be compressed. This can potentially save about 30%-40% in
               disk space (give or take), however, it slows down the
               persistence mechanism considerably. Recommended setting for
               this should be false unless something on the server deployment
               box warrants disk-saving over persistence performance.

               If this setting is defined, it will enable send throttling to
               occur while sending commands to an agent.  The format is
               defined as "max-commands:quiet-period-milliseconds"

               of commands that will be sent before the start of a quiet
               period.  The quiet period defines the number of milliseconds
               in which no commands should be sent.  After this duration
               expires, commands can again be sent, up to the maximum defined.
               Note that send throttling only affects those commands that
               are "throttle-able".  Some commands are sent as soon as
               possible, regardless of the throttling settings.
               
               This affects sending commands synchronously and asynchronously.

               If this setting is defined, it will enable queue throttling to

               defined as "max-commands-per-burst:burst-period-milliseconds"
               where the maximum commands per burst defines the maximum number
               of commands that can be dequeued within a burst period.  The
               burst period defines the number of milliseconds in which the
               defined maximum number of commands can be dequeued.  If more
               than the maximum number of commands are queued within this
               time period, they will wait until the next burst period starts
               before being able to be dequeued.
               
               This does not affect sending commands synchronously.  It only
               effects commands queued to be sent asynchronously.

               The detector will send heartbeat messages every X milliseconds

               detectors do not send their heartbeat messages within the
               default-time-delay, our detector will assume that external
               server has gone down.  These settings affect the timeliness

               These are the settings that are used if SSL is to be used for
               either the server or client communications. These can be left
               unset since the defaults will normally suffice.  These
               properties are here just in case some use case occurs that
               require one or more of these settings to be customized.
               
               Note that if client-auth-mode is specified, it must be one of:
               "none", "want", "need". To support Tomcat syntax, "true" can be used
               in place of "need" and "false" can be used in place of "none".

               is allowed to be idle before it is automatically closed and
               removed from the server. This means that a client must

               longer be available. Note that this does not mean a client
               must read or write the entire stream in this amount of time,
               it only means a client must make a request on the stream every
