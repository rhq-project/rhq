               If true, the agent will assume it is fully configured and
               will not ask setup questions when it starts up.  If false,
               the agent assumes the configuration is not complete and
               will ask a series of setup questions to the user in order
               to be fully configured.

               If you write your own custom agent configuration file, you
               will probably want to set this flag to true since you
               probably will set all of your configuration right in the
               configuration file itself.  However, you may wish to
               distribute agent configuration files with only a subset
               of configuration preferences set and rely on each agent's
               startup setup mechanism to finish its configuration - in this
               case, you'll want to leave this as false.

               EMBEDDED: this is true - we ensure the agent is fully
               configured; we have to since the agent has no console
               interface and must start in daemon mode

               Explicitly defines what the agent's name is.  This will
               default to the agent's fully qualified domain name (that is,
               the FQDN of the platform where the agent is running).  However,
               you can set this to any value you want, so long as it is
               unique among all other agents. You will need to explicitly set
               this if the agent platform's FQDN cannot be reliably determined
               at runtime.

               be manually registered via some other mechanism (e.g. the

               at least once in order to notify the RHQ Server about its
               existence and to assign the agent a valid security token.
               Note that even if this is true, the registration may not happen

               EMBEDDED: we still give an initial pause to let the server

               agent will not automatically update the plugins; the agent

               The time in milliseconds that the client sender will wait
               before aborting a command. This is the amount of time in
               milliseconds that the server has in order to process commands.
               This value is only the default if a command has not specified
               its own timeout.  A command can override this by setting its
               own timeout in the command's configuration, so this value may
               not be used for all commands that are sent. If this value is

               and commands will therefore be allowed to take as long as they
               need (again, this is the default, individual commands may
               override this and set their own timeout).  While this infinite
               timeout default could conceivably cause a thread to hang
               waiting for a rogue command that never finishes, it also reduces
               the amount of short-lived threads created by the system

               rhq.agent.client.retry-interval-msecs

               This is the minimum amount of time, in milliseconds, the client
               sender will wait before trying to resend a guaranteed command
               that previously failed.  This is not a guarantee of when
               a command is retried - all that can be inferred is that a
               command that fails to be sent will not be retried until at
               least this amount of time passes.
               Note: if the sender is currently waiting in this retry pause
               period, the agent will not be able to be shutdown until that
               retry period is over. In other words, if the agent is asked
               to shutdown, it will wait for those commands waiting in this
               retry interval to wake up. This is to help ensure those
               commands are not lost.  Keep this time period short enough
               to make agent shutdowns fairly responsive but long enough
               to avoid spinning the process with continuous resending of
               commands during periods of RHQ Server downtime. It is
               recommended to use auto-detection or server polling in order
               to automatically stop the client sender from continuously
               trying to retry commands during long periods of RHQ
               Server downtime.

               If a guaranteed delivery message is sent, but the agent fails
               to connect to the server and deliver the message, it will
               always be retried. However, if the error was something other
               than a "cannot connect" error, the command will only be retried

               happens, the guaranteed command will never be delivered. This
               will normally happen under very odd and rare circumstances.
               Also, this setting only effects asynchronous messages that
               are sent with guaranteed delivery.  This setting has no effect

               This defines the parameters for the command spool file.
               The spool file is where the agent persists commands that
               are flagged for guaranteed delivery and need to be sent.
               The format is defined as "max-file-size:purge-percentage".
               The first number is the size, in bytes, of the maximum file
               size threshold.  If the spool file grows larger than this, a
               "purge" will be triggered in order to shrink the file.
               The second number is the purge percentage which indicates how
               large the file is allowed to be after a purge.  This is
               specified as a percentage of the first parameter - the max
               file size threshold.  For example, if the max file size is
               100000 (i.e. 100KB) and the purge percentage is 90, then when
               the spool file grows larger than 100KB, a purge will be
               triggered and the file will be shrunk to no more than
               90% of 100KB - which is 90KB.  In effect, 10KB will be freed
               to allow room for new commands to be spooled.  When this
               occurs, unused space is freed first and if that does not
               free up enough space, the oldest commands in the spool file
               will be sacrificed in order to make room for the newer
               commands.

               box warrants persistence performance over disk-saving . The

               the agent under normal conditions (while running with the RHQ
               Server up and successfully communicating with the agent).

               occur while sending commands to the server.  The format is
               defined as "max-commands:quiet-period-milliseconds"
               where the maximum commands defines the maximum number
               of commands that will be sent before the start of a quiet
               period.  The quiet period defines the number of milliseconds
               in which no commands should be sent.  After this duration
               expires, commands can again be sent, up to the maximum defined.
               Note that send throttling only affects those commands that
               are "throttle-able".  Some commands are sent as soon as
               possible, regardless of the throttling settings.

               This affects sending commands synchronously and asynchronously.

               If this setting is defined, it will enable queue throttling to
               occur while sending commands to the server.  The format is
               defined as "max-commands-per-burst:burst-period-milliseconds"
               where the maximum commands per burst defines the maximum number
               of commands that can be dequeued within a burst period.  The
               burst period defines the number of milliseconds in which the
               defined maximum number of commands can be dequeued.  If more
               than the maximum number of commands are queued within this
               time period, they will wait until the next burst period starts
               before being able to be dequeued.

               This does not affect sending commands synchronously.  It only
               effects commands queued to be sent asynchronously.

               The multicast detector configuration. This is the service that
               listens for new remote servers coming on and going offline and
               is required if you want server auto-detection. If you do not

               support multicast traffic, you should disable the multicast
               detector.

               The multicast-address is used to broadcast detection messages.
               To be more specific, it is the IP address of the
               multicast group the detector will join.  The bind-address
               is the IP that is bound by the network interface.

               The detector will send heartbeat messages every X milliseconds
               (this is the heartbeat-time-delay).  If external servers'
               detectors do not send their heartbeat messages within the
               default-time-delay, our detector will assume that external
               server has gone down.  These settings affect the timeliness
               of our auto-detection mechanism.

               EMBEDDED: since the agent is running inside the server, no need
               to try to auto-discover it since, if the agent is up, it knows
               the server is, too.

               JBoss/Remoting documentation for a full list of options
               that can be specified.  Note that because this is an XML file,
               you must specify "&amp;" in the transport-params value
               when needing an ampersand to separate the parameters.

               EMBEDDED: the bind address will be overridden to be the
               one used by the server. The bind port is normally overridden
               in the jboss-service.xml also.

               These are the settings that are used if SSL is to be used for
               either the server or client communications. These can be left
               unset since the defaults will normally suffice.  These
               properties are here just in case some use case occurs that
               require one or more of these settings to be customized.

               Note that if client-auth-mode is specified, it must be one of:
               "none", "want", "need".

               EMBEDDED: the agent is in the same VM as the server so there
               is no need for transport security since traffic is never
               actually routed outside of the VM.
