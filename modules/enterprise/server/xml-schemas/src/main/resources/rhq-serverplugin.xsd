                        A class that will be notified when the plugin is started and stopped. This provides a place
                        for plugin developers to allocate global resources needed by the plugin and
                        a place to clean up those resources. This component can also be scheduled to perform periodic work.
                        The plugin component object is stateful - the instance lives for as long as the plugin
                        is initialized.

                        Scheduled jobs are pre-defined here in this special configuration. The schema
                        for this element is the same as the general configuration, however, this
                        has special semantics that require special properties to be defined.
                        If you use this element, it must contain map properties where each map:
                           1) has a name that is a method name of the plugin component. This method
                              name identifies what is called on the plugin component (or the target
                              class, see below) when the schedule triggers.
                              You may override this by defining a simple property called "methodName".
                              Whether the method name is defined by the map name itself or the optional
                              "methodName" simple property, the method signature must be either
                              a no-arg signature or one that has a single argument of type
                              ScheduledJobInvocationContext.
                           2) has simple properties called "scheduleType" and "scheduleTrigger" where
                              "scheduleType" is either "cron" or "periodic" and "scheduleTrigger" is either
                              the cron expression or a time period in milliseconds.
                           3) has a simple property called "concurrent" of type boolean to indicate if
                              multiple invocations of the scheduled job are allowed to
                              occur at the same time. If false, only one invocation will ever run at any
                              one time. This means that if a schedule triggers again while the previous
                              scheduled invocation is still running, the second invocation will be delayed
                              until after the previous invocation completes. If there is more than one
                              RHQ Server in the system, and this is false, you can be assured that only
                              a single server will handle the invocation at any one time (i.e. multiple servers
                              will not run invocations at the same time).
                           4) has an optional simple property called "class" of type string that is the
                              name of class to be instantiated as the target of the job invocation.
                              If not defined, the target of the job invocation is the stateful plugin component
                              itself. Whatever class is used as the target, it must have a method as defined
                              in the method name simple property as explained above.
                              Typically, plugin developers don't use this class property because you normally
                              want to target the stateful plugin component; however, this class property provides
                              the plugin developer a way to declare stateless jobs if that is needed.
                           5) has any other simple properties that will be used as custom callback data properties.
                        You may additionally define one list-of-maps property which can be used to allow a user
                        to define their own custom jobs. The list-of-maps must contain a map property definition
                        that follows the same rules as described above.
