# Conductor SNMP configuration file.

# This file is used to configure the Covalent SNMP Conductor agent. 
#
# All lines beginning with a '#' are comments and are intended for you
# to read. All other lines are configuration commands for the agent.

# agentaddress
#
# SYNTAX: 
#    agentaddress [(udp|tcp):]port[@address][,...] 
# DESCRIPTION: 
#    This directive specifies the port(s) and optional address the SNMP agent
#    will listen on. Multiple ports can be separated by commas. Transports can
#    be specified by prepending the port number with the transport name ("udp"
#    or "tcp") followed by a colon. To bind to a particular interface, you can
#    specify the address (@address) you want it to bind with.
# EXAMPLE:
#     agentaddress 8161,tcp:8161,9161@localhost 
#    Directs the agent to listen on udp port 8161 for any address, tcp port
#    8161 for any address, and udp port 9161 on only the interface associated
#    with the localhost address.
# DEFAULT:
#     agentaddress 161 

agentaddress ${snmp.port}@${snmp.host}

# View-based Access Control
###############################################################################
# This section explains on how to configure the View Based Access Control.
#
# If you want SNMPv1 and/or SNMPv2c access, you need to map
# the community name into a security name.
# SYNTAX:
#   com2sec <SECNAME> <NETWORK> <COMMUNITY>
# <SECNAME> is used as user within the SNMP agent.
# <NETWORK> is used to defined from which hosts or networks
#   the SNMP agent can be accessed by using the associated
#   community string.
# <COMMUNITY> is the community string as used in SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c
#   for authentication.

# You need to map the <SECNAME>'s into one or muliple groups
# and assicate a security model to it.
# SYNTAX:
#   group <GROUPNAME> <SECMODEL> <SECNAME>
# <GROUPNAME> is the idenitfication of the group.
# <SECMODEL> is the security model used. The agent
#   uses: 'v1', 'v2c', 'usm' or 'any'
# <SECNAME> is the name via which SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c
#   have access or the 'username' of SNMPv3

# You need to create a view of the MIB that can either be a
# complete or partial view.
# SYNTAX:
#   view <VIEWNAME> <TYPE> <SUBTREE> <MASK>
# <VIEWNAME> identification for a MIB view.
# <TYPE> is either 'included' or 'excluded' and perform
#   the associated action on the <SUBTREE>
# <SUBTREE> the MIB subtree to which the view applies.
# <MASK> is on the places in the OID-string for the accessed objects that
#   must be match to included in this view.

# Grant each group access and define its permissions.
# SYNTAX: access <GROUPNAME> <CONTEXT> <SECMODEL> <SECLEVEL> <MATCH> <READ> <WRITE> <NOTIFY>
# <GROUPNAME> the group identification as defined with 'group'.
# <CONTEXT> the context in which access is granted. Default ""
# <SECMODEL> the security model required to be used for access
#       The agent uses: 'v1', 'v2c', 'usm' or 'any'
# <SECLEVEL> The security level used for access to the MIB. The agent
#   uses: 'noauth', 'auth'  or 'priv'
# <MATCH> specifies how CONTEXT should be matched against the
#   context of the incoming pdu, either exact or prefix.
# <READ> specificies the view for corresponding access.
# <WRITE> specificies the view for corresponding access.
# <NOTIFY> specificies the view for corresponding access.

# User-based Security

# For SNMPv3 you need to create users. However, after starting and stopping
# you would like to delete the 'createuser' line. The SNMP agent will store
# this information encrypted, in a persistent configuration file.

# We first want to create or map the SNMPv3 user into a group and provide
# access with the above view-based access control.
# Forinstance, group MyRWGroup usm covalent

# For SNMPv3 (User-based Security) we need create a user.
