         For each measurement that should be collected for resources of this type, a metric element is added.
         In addition to identifying the metric, a default collection interval and whether or not the
         metric is even collected by default are indicated. If the resource has no measurements to be
         collected, these elements may be omitted. Note that the metric property string contains information
         like the arguments to pass to the executable and an optional regex to use to pick out the metric
         value from the output of the executable. The arguments are specified inside curly braces. If the metric
         value is the entire output, you do not have to specify a regex, the output will be assumed to be
         the value of the metric in that case. If regex is explicitly the string "exitcode", the metric value will be
         the CLI executable's exitcode value.
