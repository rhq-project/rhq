tionally, the authentication spoofing and authentication data
verification and substitution occur on the client side.  The se-
curity risk of using X11 forwarding is that the client's X11 dis-
play server may be exposed to attack when the SSH client requests
forwarding (see the warnings for ForwardX11 in ssh_config(5)).  A
system administrator may have a stance in which they want to pro-
tect clients that may expose themselves to attack by unwittingly
requesting X11 forwarding, which can warrant a ``no'' setting.
